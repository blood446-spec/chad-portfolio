## 🧠 About Me

I use AI to turn ideas into real, working tools — apps, automations, workflows, and digital products.  
My passion is helping people who feel stuck finally build what’s been in their head for years, using AI to bridge the gap between *idea* and *execution*.

My background is unconventional: CDL driver, equipment operator, supervisor, FedEx operations, PennDOT FD4…  
but AI unlocked a new path for me — and now I build powerful solutions every day using GPT, Cursor, Claude, and modern AI tools.

## ⭐ Fun Fact  
I get into a deep flow state when building with AI — everything around me disappears, and all that exists is the project.  
That’s how I know this is what I’m meant to be doing.
